# Backtracking

## Story behind this project
This project was an attempt to visualize the backtracking algorithms. I finally understood the Nqueens_backtracking algorithm and 
how it worked. This was possible due to some GIFs I saw somewhere.

I decided to make the visualization using p5.js which is a Javascript Framework made by [Processing Foundation](https://processing.org/). 
I had always wanted to make visualizations and more web apps stuff but there always has been some kind of other college work or 
other more programming work. But, this time, I allotted a few days into this and kept Competitive programming on hold(I do it as a hobby but I am not good, it takes a lot of practice.)

I learnt the basics of processing from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=daniel+shiffman) and the documentation.
Daniel Shiffman's channel is one of the best channels on YouTube for creative coding and programming in general. I got really inspired by him.


## What the hell is Backtracking?
- Backtracking is a form of recursion. If you don't understand recursion, maybe backtracking problems can help you understand it.
- The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options;   just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good       sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.
